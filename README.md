# Reddit clone and discussion forum

This repo is used primarily as an exercise to re-engineer some of the features and functionality in popular discussion forums such as Reddit.

#### Main featutures that have been implemented:

* Markdown parser that converts text on post and comment submissions using the gem [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet)
* To extend this, code can be syntax highlighted with the help of the gem [coderay](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay)
* Users can post discussions to specific channels (subreddits), where they can view posts specific to that channel/subreddit, but also have all recent posts visible on the front page from all channels.
* Admin roles have been implemented that limit channel creation. Only Admins can create/destroy whole channels(subreddits). Admins also have the power to delete or edit individual posts, regardless of who submitted them.(just like reddit....)
* Unique link slugs have been implemented to replace the ugly autogenerated links based on post ids. Instead of accessing `reddit-clone.com/posts/131` the full link would be something along the lines of `reddit-clone.com/posts/why-adding-friendly-slugs-is-better`


The following list of gems have been added to enhance the functionality of targetted features

```ruby
gem 'rolify', '~> 5.2'
gem 'cancancan', '~> 2.1', '>= 2.1.3'
gem 'friendly_id', '~> 5.2', '>= 5.2.3'
gem 'redcarpet', '~> 3.4'
gem 'coderay', '~> 1.1', '>= 1.1.2'
```
